NASDAQ and COVID 19 :
Base on the correlation table, Nasdaq daily close prices have a moderate positive relationship with total cases and total deaths (globally and in the USA). Their correlation values are around 0.7 and P-values are 0.000 which means Probably dependent.
Volume traded has a positive correlation with cases, but weaker than cases and price (around 0.45).
Deaths due to covid have a fairly positive correlation with prices (around 0.69), but weaker if compared to volume (0.48).
Recovered people have a positive correlation with price (0.7), also weaker positive correlation with volume (0.41).
In general, deaths and cases have a high positive correlation with prices, but the correlation is weaker with volume traded. There are also some ambiguities with values that are correlated to each other, for example, deaths and new deaths, but surprisingly very different values when comparing these two variables to Bitcoin and Nasdaq.
Beginning February 21st through March 23st, NASDAQ prices had a very large drop from $9,576.59 to $6,860.67. This is a drop of $2,715.92 in the small time of a month.
The drop first began days before the economy began to show a freefall on February 24th and continues until the United States has reached over 1,000 deaths reported on March 26th and has around 10K new cases per day since mid March.
The graphs show that apart from that drop. The price for close, open, high, and low, of a day increases from March 24th until July 27th. The increase in prices begins days before Trump signs a stimulus package for Americans on March 26th. This could explain the rise for a while but the reason as to why the price continues to rise steadily is still being analyzed.
 Bitcoin vs Covid-19 :
Base on the correlation table, Bitcoin daily Volume have a moderate negative relationship with total cases and total deaths (globally and in the USA). Their correlation values are range from -0.6 to -0.7 and P values are 0.000 which means Probably dependent.
Even though the volume and close price of Bitcoin are slightly negatively correlated (-0.28), close price goes up when cases of sick people are discovered.
In general, price increases when more people get sick, but volumes traded decrease.
A remarkable high negative correlation (-0.7) was found between volume and recovered people.
The price of Bitcoin significantly dropped on March 12, 2020 a day before President Donald Trump declared a national emergency concerning the coronavirus outbreak. It dropped from 7911.43 to 4970.788 USD, and for the next six days it had minor swings but stayed in the five thousand range. In the meanwhile, we can see the global new case and global new deaths number begin to rase in a higher speed (the slop of the graphs).
On April 29th 2020 (leap year) travel restrictions lifts were mentioned across the globe despite the rise of world wide coronavirus. Switzerland, Spain, Germany, Greece, and Hong Kong all reported their action plan to facilitate traveling in their countries. Bitcoin showed a 1k jump in price from 7807.059 to 8801.038 USD.
On March 19th 2020  president Donald Trump signed the covid-19 relief bill providing paid leave to a small fraction of U.S workers. Bitcoin closed that day at 6191.193 compared to the previous day of 5238.438 USD
The elaborated graphs show that the global and U.S total cases only rose, but Bitcoin had more of a wave like characteristics with multiple rise and drops this year.

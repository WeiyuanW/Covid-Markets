nsd = pd.read_excel('Nasdaq vs Covid.xlsx')

**Nasdaq Price change:**

nsd["price_change"] = (nsd.Close - nsd.Open)/nsd.Open

idx = nsd.index.get_loc(nsd[nsd['Date'] == '2020/06/01'].index[0])

a_idx = nsd.iloc[idx : idx + 5]

# Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test (not normal distributed) for Nasdaq price change before & after even date "03/06/2020"  
stat, p = mannwhitneyu(b_idx.price_change, a_idx.price_change)
p

Conlusion: There is no enough evidence to show that Nasdaq daily price change is significantly different between days before and after COVID event at 03/06/2020.
We can say this because the pvalue(0.20170) is about our 0.05 alpha, meaning they are not significantly different.


**Nasdaq Volume:**

idx = nsd.index.get_loc(nsd[nsd['Date'] == '2020/6/10'].index[0])
b_idx = nsd.iloc[idx - 5: idx]
a_idx = nsd.iloc[idx : idx + 5]

# Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test (not normal distributed) for Nasdaq price change before & after even date "06/10/2020"  
stat, p = mannwhitneyu(b_idx.Volume, a_idx.Volume)
p

There is enough evidence that Nasdaq daily volume is significantly different between days before and after COVID event at 06/10/2020.
We can say this because the pvalue(0.03005) is below our 0.05 alpha, meaning they are significantly different.

**Bitcoin Price change:**

btc["price_change"] = (btc.Close - btc.Open)/btc.Open

idx = btc.index.get_loc(btc[btc['Date'] == '2020/03/13'].index[0])
b_idx = btc.iloc[idx - 5: idx]
a_idx = btc.iloc[idx : idx + 5]

# Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test (not normal distributed) for Bitcoin price change before & after even date "03/13/2020"  
stat, p = mannwhitneyu(b_idx.price_change, a_idx.price_change)
p

Conlusion: There is no enough evidence to show that Btcoin daily price change is significantly different between days before and after COVID event at 03/13/2020.
We can say this because the pvalue(0.10504) is about our 0.05 alpha, meaning they are not significantly different.


**Bitcoin Volume:**

idx = btc.index.get_loc(btc[btc['Date'] == '2020/02/06'].index[0])
b_idx = btc.iloc[idx - 5: idx]
a_idx = btc.iloc[idx : idx + 5]

# Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test (not normal distributed) for Nasdaq price change before & after even date "02/06/2020"  
stat, p = mannwhitneyu(b_idx.Volume, a_idx.Volume)
p

Conlusion: There is enough evidence to show that Btcoin daily volume is significantly different between days before and after COVID event at 02/06/2020.
We can say this because the pvalue(0.01836) is below our 0.05 alpha, meaning they are significantly different.
